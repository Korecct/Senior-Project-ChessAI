<p>The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, putting it in a position where it’s in danger of capture and there’s no legal move to escape.</p>
<p>The board is an 8x8 grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns.</p>
<p>Each piece has specific movement rules:<p>
</p>The king moves 1 square in any direction.</p>
<p>The queen moves any number of squares in any direction.</p>
<p>The rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</p>
<p>The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally.</p> 
<p>The knight moves in an L-shape (2 squares in one direction and then 1 square perpendicular).</p>
<p>The pawn moves 1 square forward (2 squares on its first move) and captures diagonally.</p>
<p>Special moves include castling, where the king moves 2 squares towards a rook and the rook moves to the square next to the king, under certain conditions. En Passant is a pawn capturing move that occurs when a pawn moves 2 squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent’s pawn. Pawn promotion happens when a pawn reaches the far end of the board and can be promoted to any piece except a king.</p>
<p>Check means the king is under direct threat of capture, and the player must make a move to remove the threat. Checkmate occurs when the king is in check and cannot escape, ending the game.</p>
<p>Draws can happen for several reasons, including insufficient material to checkmate, threefold repetition, or a stalemate, where a player has no legal moves but is not in check.</p>
<p>Players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn.</p>
