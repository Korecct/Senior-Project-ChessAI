                <h2>Draws</h2>
                <p>A draw in chess can occur under several conditions. Understanding these rules is essential for recognizing when a game cannot be won by either player. The primary draw conditions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Threefold Repetition:</strong> This occurs when the same position is repeated three times with the same player to move and all possible moves remaining the same each time. A player can claim a draw if this repetition happens, ensuring that the game does not continue indefinitely without progress.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Insufficient Material:</strong> If neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate, the game is declared a draw. Common scenarios include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>King vs. King</li>
                            <li>King and Bishop vs. King</li>
                            <li>King and Knight vs. King</li>
                            <li>King and Bishop vs. King and Bishop (with both bishops on the same color squares)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Stalemate:</strong> This happens when a player has no legal moves available and is not in check. In such cases, the game ends immediately in a draw.</li>

                    <li><strong>Fifty-Move Rule:</strong> If fifty consecutive moves have been made by both players without any pawn movement or any capture, either player can claim a draw. This rule prevents games from dragging on without progress.</li>

                    <li><strong>Mutual Agreement:</strong> Both players can agree to a draw at any point during the game. This often occurs when both players recognize that neither can force a win.</li>
                </ul>
